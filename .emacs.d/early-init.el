;; Performance Hacks
;; Emacs is an Elisp interpreter, and when running programs or packages,
;; it can occasionally experience pauses due to garbage collection.
;; By increasing the garbage collection threshold, we reduce these pauses
;; during heavy operations, leading to smoother performance.
(setq gc-cons-threshold #x40000000)

;; Set the maximum output size for reading process output, allowing for larger data transfers.
(setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024 4))

;; Don't load package.el since we're using Straight
